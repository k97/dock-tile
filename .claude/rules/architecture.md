# Architecture

## Multi-Instance Model

Users create Helper Bundles (copies of main app) stored in `~/Library/Application Support/DockTile/`. Each maintains independent app lists and icons. Shared config at `~/Library/Preferences/com.docktile.configs.json`.

## Helper Bundle Lifecycle

**Creation** (`HelperBundleManager.installHelper`):
1. Copies main DockTile.app as template
2. **Removes `Assets.car`** — prevents main app icon overriding custom icons (macOS prioritises asset catalogs over `CFBundleIconFile`)
3. Updates Info.plist (unique bundle ID, name, LSUIElement based on mode)
4. Generates `.icns` icon for all 4 style variants
5. Code signs with ad-hoc signature
6. Saves/restores Dock position, restarts Dock, launches helper

**Runtime** (`HelperAppDelegate`): Sets activation policy based on Ghost/App mode, shows NSPopover on click.

**Deletion** (`HelperBundleManager.uninstallHelper`): Quits helper → removes from Dock plist → deletes bundle → restarts Dock. Uses `async Task.sleep` (not sync `Thread.sleep`).

## Ghost Mode vs App Mode

macOS constraint: no supported way to have Dock icon + hidden from Cmd+Tab + working context menu simultaneously.

| Mode | `showInAppSwitcher` | `LSUIElement` | Cmd+Tab | Context Menu |
|------|---------------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| Ghost (default) | `false` | `true` | Hidden | No |
| App | `true` | Not set | Visible | Yes |

Set in `HelperBundleManager.updateInfoPlist()` (build time) and `HelperAppDelegate.applicationWillFinishLaunching()` (runtime).

## NSPopover Positioning

`FloatingPanel.swift` anchors to Dock edge using `visibleFrame` boundary (not mouse position):
- Compares `NSScreen.main.frame` vs `visibleFrame` to detect Dock side (largest gap = Dock location)
- Anchors flush to `visibleFrame.minY/minX/maxX` — mouse coordinate only for the axis parallel to the Dock
- `NSVisualEffectView` with `.popover` material for native vibrancy
- Keyboard navigation via `KeyboardCaptureView` (custom NSView)

## Dock Integration (CFPreferences API)

All Dock plist operations use `CFPreferencesCopyAppValue`/`CFPreferencesSetAppValue` with `"com.apple.dock"`. Matches industry tools (dockutil), avoids `cfprefsd` cache sync issues from direct plist file writing.

Race condition prevention: `installingBundleIds` and `removingBundleIds` Sets prevent double operations.

## Dock Position Preservation

`lastDockIndex` (v5 field) persists tile position across show/hide toggles. `findDockIndex(bundleId:)` saves position before removal; `addToDock(at:atIndex:)` restores it.

## Dock Plist Watcher & Visibility Sync

`DockPlistWatcher.swift` monitors `com.apple.dock.plist` via `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` to detect manual tile removals and sync `isVisibleInDock` state.

**Visibility ownership (critical invariant)**: `isVisibleInDock` is written **only** by `DockTileDetailView.performDockAction()`, after the Dock add/remove actually completes. The Show Tile toggle must **not** persist visibility via the debounced auto-save — that decoupling caused a "hidden in config but still pinned in Dock" desync that never self-healed. The auto-save preserves the stored visibility/`lastDockIndex`.

`ConfigurationManager.syncDockVisibility(reconcileDockedHiddenTiles:)` reconciles **both** directions: visible-but-absent → mark hidden; and (launch only, `reconcile=true`) hidden-but-still-pinned → actually remove. The destructive direction runs only on the one-shot launch sync, never the live watcher (avoids restart loops).

**Never-pinned guard (critical)**: direction 1 (visible-but-absent → mark hidden) must skip tiles that were **never pinned** — gated on `HelperBundleManager.helperExists(for:)`. A brand-new tile defaults to `isVisibleInDock = true` but has no helper bundle on disk until the user clicks **Add to Dock**; without this guard the reconciler flips it hidden, the action button degrades "Add to Dock" → "Done", and the tile never pins. (A genuinely removed tile keeps its bundle on disk, so the guard only spares new tiles.) This regressed when #5 stopped the editor auto-save re-asserting visibility — the premature hide then stuck instead of bouncing back.

**Helpers must not touch the Dock**: helper processes also construct a `ConfigurationManager` (for popover config), so `init()` returns early via `AppEnvironment.isHelper` before `startDockWatcher()`/`syncDockVisibility()` — only the main app watches/reconciles the Dock, preventing multi-writer races on the config file and Dock plist.

## Popover Configure Gear Icon

Both `StackPopoverView` (grid) and `ListPopoverView` (list) have a gear icon that opens the main app to configure that tile. Posts `.openConfigurator` notification → `HelperAppDelegate` handles routing via `docktile://configure?bundleId=...` deep link. Routes to correct build: DerivedData for dev, `/Applications/` for release.

Helper bundles have `CFBundleURLTypes` stripped from Info.plist (prevents helpers from claiming the URL scheme).

## Helper Migration Pipeline

`HelperMigrationManager` detects stale helper bundles on main app launch and batch-regenerates them with a single Dock restart.

**Version tracking**: `helperAppVersion` (v6 schema field) stamps which app version built each helper. `nil` = pre-migration, treated as stale.

**Flow**: Check `UserDefaultsKeys.lastMigratedAppVersion` → find stale visible helpers → quit → regenerate bundle in-place via `HelperBundleManager.regenerateHelperBundle()` → single Dock restart → relaunch all.

**Edge cases**: Missing bundle on disk → stamp and skip. Not in Dock → stamp and skip. Regeneration fails → log error, stamp version anyway (no retry loop). Already migrated → immediate return.

## Missing App Detection

Tiles reference apps by `bundleIdentifier` (+ `lastKnownPath`, v8). When an app is uninstalled,
`AppIconLoader` used to fall back to the cached `iconData` and paint the **stale icon at full
opacity**, hiding the "app is gone" state. Detection now flags those apps instead.

- **Two-signal check**: `AppItem.lastKnownPath` (v8 field, stamped on add, healed on scan) is a
  second installation signal beside the bundle ID. Distinguishes a real uninstall from a
  transiently-unregistered Launch Services entry, and lets a **moved/updated** app self-heal by
  re-resolving rather than being flagged.
- **Pure seam**: `AppInstallChecker.classifyInstallStatus(bundleResolves:onDiskPathExists:)` →
  `.installed` / `.missing` (in `AppIconLoader.swift`, unit-tested). Installed = LS resolves the
  bundle ID **or** an app bundle exists on disk (last-known path / common dir); else missing. A
  cached `iconData` is **not** an install signal — it's DockTile's own snapshot. (An earlier
  `.unknown` case exempted pre-v8 entries that had a cached icon but no path; since *every* legacy
  entry fits that shape, any app uninstalled before upgrading was permanently un-flagged and kept
  its stale icon. Removed — detection is non-destructive, so flag it; a rare transient miss
  self-heals next scan.)
- **Sweep**: `ConfigurationManager.scanForMissingApps()` runs **once per session** on window launch
  (after migration), throttled like `lastMigratedAppVersion`. Cheap — LS lookups + `stat()`, no
  icon rasterisation. **Main-app only** (`AppEnvironment.isHelper` guard), heals paths, publishes
  `missingAppIDs`.
- **UX is non-destructive** (critical): missing apps render a distinct `questionmark.app.dashed`
  placeholder (dimmed + "Not installed"), never the stale icon. A consolidated **Remove / Keep**
  alert is the *only* path that deletes — detection flakiness must never cause silent data loss.
  Helper popovers resolve status **synchronously** in the view body so a deleted app never flashes
  its stale icon before the placeholder.

## User Consent for Dock Modifications

One-time consent dialog (NSAlert) before any Dock-modifying action. Preference stored as `UserDefaultsKeys.hasAcknowledgedDockRestart`. Covers add, update, show, hide, and remove operations.

## Popover Appearance (per-layout settings)

App-wide controls for how every tile's Dock popover looks — Popover Size, Tile Size, Animation,
Spacing, Highlight on Hover, plus Grid-only Show Labels. **Grid and List are configured
independently** (see below). Reached via **Settings → General → Appearance** — a `NavigationStack`
drill-down inside `GeneralSettingsView` (NOT a separate sidebar pane), titled "Appearance" with a
"‹ General" back. Per-tile Grid/List (which layout a tile uses) still lives on Tile Detail.

- **Per-layout, independent configs (critical)**: Grid and List are configured **separately** —
  `PopoverSettings.load(layout:)` / `.persist(layout:)` read/write a distinct key namespace per
  layout (`popover.grid.*` vs `popover.list.*`). A grid tile loads `.grid`, a list tile `.list`
  (`StackPopoverView`→grid, `ListPopoverView`→list). List has **no** `showLabels` key (a list popover
  always labels its rows) — `persist(.list)` skips it and `load(.list)` resolves it to `true`. The
  pane's **Layout** segmented control is a **panel switcher labelled "Configure", NOT a persisted
  setting**: it selects which independent config (`gridDraft`/`listDraft`) the form edits and the
  preview shows. Every control handler routes through the *active* config (via `activeDraft`); Show
  Labels writes only the grid config and its row is hidden on List (replaced by a static note). Reset
  resets only the active config; Save commits both. Guarded by `gridAndListPersistIndependently` /
  `listSkipsShowLabels` tests.
- **Persistence**: all keys live in the **shared suite** (`com.docktile.shared`, like analytics
  consent), so HELPER processes — which actually render the popover — read the same values. Defaults
  in `PopoverSettings.default` keep absent keys roomy. Model: [PopoverAppearance.swift](../../DockTile/Models/PopoverAppearance.swift).
- **Explicit save (draft/commit), NOT auto-save**: the pane is no longer `@AppStorage`-backed.
  Edits stage into a `@State draft: PopoverSettings`; only the **Save** toolbar button writes them to
  the shared suite via `PopoverSettings.persist()` (the symmetric counterpart to `load()`). A
  `savedBaseline` drives dirty state. **Reset to Defaults** stages `.default` into the draft (still
  needs Save to commit). HIG toolbar placement (`.primaryAction`): Reset is a secondary **icon-only**
  button (`arrow.counterclockwise`, `.bordered`, `.labelStyle(.iconOnly)`) with a `.help("Reset to
  Defaults")` tooltip + accessibility label; Save is the trailing primary (`.borderedProminent`, ⌘S).
  Save disables when not dirty, Reset when already at defaults. Save styling (Tahoe toolbar quirks):
  the label is forced `.foregroundStyle(.white)` because the toolbar otherwise tints a
  `.borderedProminent` label the accent colour (blue-on-blue, unreadable in light mode); and the
  disabled look is a uniform `.opacity(0.45)` on the whole button — `.disabled()` alone dims only the
  label there (bright fill + faded text), and `.tint(_.opacity())` is ignored by the prominent fill,
  so fading the rendered button is the only way to get one evenly-dimmed "disabled blue". The live preview renders the **draft** (not the shared suite) via a new
  `settingsOverride: PopoverSettings?` param on `StackPopoverView`/`ListPopoverView` (nil in the real
  popover, which always loads saved values), so unsaved edits preview without persisting.
- **Apply-on-Save (push to running helpers)**: persisting alone only affects the *next* popover open.
  So after Save, if any tile is pinned, the pane offers to push immediately:
  `HelperMigrationManager.reapply(_:)` rebuilds + relaunches every visible helper (reusing the launch
  migration's batch + single Dock restart) so their popovers adopt the new look now. Gated by a
  one-time confirmation (the Dock restarts) remembered in
  `UserDefaultsKeys.hasAcknowledgedPopoverApplyRestart`. **Read/write that consent with explicit
  `UserDefaults.standard`, NOT `@AppStorage`** — a cross-process cfprefsd cache split made `@AppStorage`
  read a stale `true`, silently skipping the prompt. Save shows an "Applying…" spinner during the
  rebuild (`@State isApplying`).
- **Pure metrics seam** (`PopoverMetrics`, `PopoverSettings.resolve`): the single source of truth
  mapping tiers → concrete sizes. Drives BOTH the live preview and the real `StackPopoverView` /
  `ListPopoverView`, so they can't drift. Unit-tested (`PopoverMetricsTests`). Popover Size = grid
  column count (Small 4 / Medium 5 / Large 6) **capped at the app count** so few-app tiles stay tight
  — meaning Popover Size is a visual no-op for a tile with ≤4 apps (the preview uses 6 sample apps so
  all three tiers differ). Animation is forced to 0 when system Reduce Motion is on.
- **Applied to real helper popovers** (per-tile by layout): `LauncherView` routes each helper to
  `StackPopoverView` (grid tiles) or `ListPopoverView` (list tiles) by the tile's own
  `layoutMode`; each reads its own config via `PopoverSettings.load(layout:)` (grid tiles `.grid`,
  list tiles `.list`) from the shared suite, so each tile is styled by the matching layout's config. `FloatingPanel` sizes the NSPopover from the SwiftUI
  content (`NSHostingController.sizingOptions = [.preferredContentSize]`) — NOT a hard-coded size —
  so Popover Size / Tile Size / Spacing / Labels actually resize the real Dock popover to match the
  metrics-driven content (and the preview). The popover content is rebuilt on every `show()`, so a
  running helper re-reads settings on the next open; existing helpers pick up the feature when they
  are regenerated (Update-after-edit, or the version-bump migration pipeline).
- **Live preview = the real panels** (critical): the hero embeds the actual `StackPopoverView` /
  `ListPopoverView` (not a mock) for true 1:1 fidelity, re-`.id(previewSignature)`'d on every control
  change so they re-render the active draft (passed in via `settingsOverride`, not a suite read). Two
  view flags keep this safe (both default to shipping
  behaviour): `showsBackground:false` lets the preview supply its own popover chrome (NSPopover's
  rounded surface is lost when embedding the bare content view — reproduce it with the `.popover`
  material `withinWindow` + ~14pt continuous corner + shadow); `isPreview:true` keeps the panel
  interactive for hover yet neutralises every action (clicks never launch apps / open the
  configurator). The preview hero sits on the shared `StudioCanvasBackgroundView` (same
  `underWindowBackground` treatment as the Customise-Tile studio).
- **Hover highlight**: mouse hover uses the subtle Liquid-Glass `.quaternary` fill (the Tahoe
  treatment), NOT the bold accent — the accent is reserved for keyboard-focus selection. Applies to
  the real popover too. The preview scales with `.scaleEffect` (a *fixed* per-layout fit, not a
  width-refill, so Spacing changes stay visible); `.scaleEffect` preserves `.onHover` hit-testing.
